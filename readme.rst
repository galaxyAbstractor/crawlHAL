Info
========
Currently it is a very basic draft to a crawler.

Changes
========
* Dec 19, 2010: Markov chain integration. You can now talk to the bot, but it's replies are quite stupid and often not related to what you feed in... Have to check up on that...
* Dec 18, 2010: Crawler doesn't get stuck anymore. Some filetypes filtered out(images, archives etc), urlFiled validation (not empty and protocol), some GUI fixes.
* Dec 17, 2010: Changed from LinkedList to HashSet to store URLs. Crawler gets stuck on Japanese etc characters...
* Dec 16, 2010: Crawler doesn't get stuck anymore. Added some debug stats. URL and filetype validation needs to be made
* Dec 15, 2010: Developement started, crawler gets stuck
